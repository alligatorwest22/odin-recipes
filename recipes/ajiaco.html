    <h2>What is Ajiaco?</h2>
    <p>
        Ajiaco is one of the many regional Colombian dishes you can’t leave the country without trying. It’s a hearty soup made from three different kinds of potatoes (criolla, sabanera and pastusa), chicken, guasca leaves, with a half an ear of corn splashed in for good measure. Most times, Ajiaco is accompanied by a plate of rice and a slice of avocado. A helping of capers and something similar to sour cream is sometimes provided to mix with the soup if you choose.
